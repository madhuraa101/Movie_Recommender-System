# Movie_Recommender-System 
This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommender System built using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
It recommends movies similar to a user-selected movie based on metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and overview.

The application is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface.
